### 🎯 Target Core
*Which core does this apply to? (Check all that apply)*
- [ ] **Faithful 4004** (Historical Recreation)
- [ ] **Pipelined 4004** (Modernized/Compatible)
- [ ] **RISC-4** (New Custom ISA)
- [ ] **System/Tools** (Makefiles, Cocotb, etc.)

### 📝 Description
*What do you want to add or change?*

### 🔨 Engineering Context
*Why is this necessary? (e.g., "The carry-lookahead adder will reduce latency in the EX stage" or "This makefile target simplifies the waveform viewer").*

### 📉 Potential Impact
*Does this increase area (transistor count)? Does it break binary compatibility?*
