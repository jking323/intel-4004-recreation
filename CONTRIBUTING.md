# Contributing to the 4004 Recreation Project

Thank you for your interest in this project!

## 🎓 Project Philosophy: A Personal Research Journey

This repository serves as a **living research document** and a personal engineering portfolio. My goal is to recreate the Intel 4004 to deeply understand the decisions made by Federico Faggin in 1971, and to document my own journey traveling to Italy to trace the chip's origins.

Because I am using this work to write technical papers and document a specific personal narrative, **I am currently NOT accepting code contributions (Pull Requests) for the core RTL, testbenches, or documentation.**

I want every line of code in the CPU cores to be a reflection of my own learning process, even if that means it isn't perfect.

## 🤝 How You Can Still Participate

While the engineering is a solo pursuit, I would love the community's help in other ways:

### 1. 🎨 Submit Silicon Artwork
I want the physical chip to carry the spirit of the open-source community!
* I **AM** accepting Pull Requests for the `artwork/` directory.
* If you want your doodle, signature, or symbol etched onto the final silicon die, please see [artwork/README.md](artwork/README.md).

### 2. 🐛 Bug Reports & Discussions
If you spot a bug in my logic or a historical inaccuracy in my documentation, please let me know!
* Open a **GitHub Issue**.
* I appreciate the "code review"—it helps me learn—but please allow me to write the fix myself so I can understand the solution.

### 3. 💬 Discussion
Feel free to use the **Discussions** tab to ask questions about the 4004, the history, or my travel logs.

## ⚖️ A Note on Attribution

Since this project is intended for publication and academic presentation:
* The core engineering (SystemVerilog/Verilog) remains the sole work of the author (Jeremy King).
* Artwork contributors will be credited in the `artwork/AUTHORS.md` file and, space permitting, on the physical silicon itself.

Thank you for respecting the nature of this project and for following along with my journey!
